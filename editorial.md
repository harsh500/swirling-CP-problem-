The concept used here is of the cycles from grouping theory.Initially we start by finding where does 1 goes after 1 transformation . Suppose 1 goes to x ,now we find where does x goes after 1 transformation. We will keep doing that until we reach 1 again. Now we will keep track of the numbers encountered during this process and these numbers form a cycle. Now we will find all such cycles and their cardinalities. Suppose the cardinality of particular cycle is x then for m*x transformation we get the original position of the elements in the cycle where m is integer. Hence we have to find the lcm of the cardinalities of all cycles.
